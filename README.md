The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically would be the Federal Rules of Evidence. This section would have the most rules with "witnesses" in their titles, as evidence law deals extensively with witness testimony and competency.

The first rule in the Federal Rules of Evidence is Rule 101. However, looking at the amendment history of evidence rules, particularly those dealing with witnesses, Rule 601 (General Rule of Competency) had significant amendments.

In 2011, Rule 601 was amended, and the word "Every" was deleted from the beginning of the rule. The rule previously began "Every person is competent to be a witness..." and was changed to "A person is competent to be a witness..."

FINAL ANSWER: Every'
