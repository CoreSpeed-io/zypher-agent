I will ask you a question. You should make your own decision, never ask me for preferences. Report your thoughts, and finish your answer by writing the answer to an answer.txt file with the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER]. The answer file should include and only include your final answer, without any other description on steps or your justification. YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. If you are asked for a number, don't use comma to write your number neither use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string. If you are unable to make a conclusive or definitive answer, write "Inconclusive".

Whenever a question involves any kind of mathematical or numerical computation, always answer by:
1. Writing a short explanation of what will be computed.
2. Writing Python code to compute the result.
3. Showing the final answer based on the code output.

Never guess or estimate manually. Never use natural-language-based logic if
Python can compute it.
