I will ask you a question. Report your thoughts, and finish your answer by writing the answer to an answer.txt file with the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER]. The answer file should include and only include your final answer, without any other description on steps or your justification. YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. If you are asked for a number, don't use comma to write your number neither use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string. If you are unable to make a conclusive or definitive answer, write "Inconclusive". Make your own decision, never ask the user's preferences.

<calculating>
Whenever a question involves any kind of mathematical or numerical computation, always answer by:
1. Writing a short explanation of what will be computed.
2. Writing Python code to compute the result.
3. Showing the final answer based on the code output.

Never guess or estimate manually. Never use natural-language-based logic if
Python can compute it.

Question: If we assume all articles published by Nature in 2020 (articles, only, not book reviews/columns, etc) relied on statistical significance to justify their findings and they on average came to a p-value of 0.04, how many papers would be incorrect as to their claims of statistical significance? Round the value up to the next integer.
Steps:
1. Find how many articles were published in Nature in 2020 by Googling "articles submitted to nature 2020".
2. Click through to Nature's archive for 2020 and filter the results to only provide articles, not other types of publications: 1002.
3. Find 4% of 1002 and round up: 0.04 * 1002 = 40.08 → round up to 41.
Final answer: 41

Question: In Unlambda, what exact character or text needs to be added to correct
the following code to output "For penguins"? If what is needed is a character,
answer with the name of the character. If there are different names for the
character, use the shortest. The text location is not needed. Code:

\`r\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`.F.o.r. .p.e.n.g.u.i.n.si Steps:

1. Searched "Unlambda syntax" online.
2. Referred to the Wikipedia article on Unlambda.
3. Compared the provided code to the known Unlambda hello world example.
4. Counted the number of periods (output characters): 12.
5. Counted the number of backticks after the initial \`r: only 11.
6. Concluded that one backtick is missing. Final answer: backtick

Question: Using the Biopython library in Python, parse the PDB file of the
protein identified by the PDB ID 5wb7 from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Calculate
the distance between the first and second atoms as they are listed in the PDB
file. Report the answer in Angstroms, rounded to the nearest picometer. Steps:

1. Download the PDB file for 5wb7 from RCSB.org.
2. Use Biopython’s PDBParser to load the structure.
3. Use structure.get_atoms() to extract the first two atoms.
4. Calculate the distance between them using \`atom1 - atom2\`.
5. Result is approximately 1.456423 Å → round to 1.456 Å. Final answer: 1.456

Question: What's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the
headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's
headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?
Steps:

1. Open Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard site.
2. Identify the oldest flavor listed: Dastardly Mash.
3. Look at the blurred headstone behind it and identify it as Miz Jelena's Sweet
   Potato Pie.
4. Visit that flavor's page and read the poem.
5. Copy the final line of the rhyme. Final answer: So we had to let it die.
